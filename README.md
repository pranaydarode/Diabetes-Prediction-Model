1. Overview
The goal of this project is to improve the accuracy of diabetes prediction, which is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment. Weâ€™ve used a random forest model to classify whether a patient has diabetes or not.

2. Dataset
Weâ€™ve used the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset for training and evaluation. The dataset contains information about patientsâ€™ health indicators and diabetes status.

3. Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies (Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, etc.). You can find the necessary packages in the requirements.txt file.

4. Usage
Explore the Jupyter Notebook (Diabetes_detection.ipynb) to understand the step-by-step process.
Preprocess the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the random forest classifier using the training data.
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy and F1-score.
Predict diabetes for new data points using the trained model.

5. Model Evaluation
Accuracy: Measure of overall correctness of predictions.
F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

6. Contributing
